Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet.

I have been diving into performance problems for over 10 years. Problems have ranged from hardware tunning and kernel hacking to application and algorithm optimizations.
 
It is not uncommong to find me taking detours into building analytic tools, since in my opinion, performacne analysis is a special case of data science. Currently, I am helping to build and strengthen performance and kernel engineering efforts at Verizon Digital Media.
