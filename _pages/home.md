Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet.

I have been diving into performance problems for over 10 years. The problems have ranged from hardware tunning and kernel hacking to application and algorithm optimizations.
 
It is not uncommon to find me taking detours into building analytic tools, since in my opinion, performance analysis is a specialized data science workflow. Currently, I am helping to build and strengthen systems, performance, and kernel engineering efforts at Verizon Media.
